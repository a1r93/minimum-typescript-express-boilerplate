# minimum-typescript-express-boilerplate

Really minimalistic boilerplate with typescript setup for express server

##Â To launch

```
npm install
npm start

OR

yarn
yarn start
```

then try to connect to http://localhost:8000, it should print Hello World!

Note that the index file is the src/app.ts file and NOT the ./server.ts file which is juste used in order to call app.ts
